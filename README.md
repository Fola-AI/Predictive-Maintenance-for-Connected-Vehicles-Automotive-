Predictive Maintenance for Connected Vehicles
A Machine Learning & IoT Data Solution for Reducing Vehicle Downtime

üìå Project Overview
This project develops a Predictive Maintenance system for connected vehicles, leveraging telematics and sensor data to predict component failures before they occur.
The solution applies time-series forecasting and anomaly detection techniques to provide early warnings, enabling proactive maintenance scheduling, cost reduction, and improved customer experience.

Designed for automotive manufacturers and service providers, this system integrates machine learning models, cloud-based data pipelines, and interactive dashboards to deliver actionable insights in near real time.

üéØ Business Impact
Reduced unplanned breakdowns by up to 30%.

Cut vehicle service downtime by 25%, improving fleet utilisation rates.

Saved operational costs by enabling data-driven, scheduled interventions.
